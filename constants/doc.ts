# Technical explanation of the project
This project was done as a technical test for a position as a full stack software engineer. The requirements were to build an application the retrieves everyday data from and API, store this data on a database and serve this data in a small frontend and via an API.

On top of that, some ground rules were established as follows: 
* Do not spend more than 3-4 hours on the test
* Itâ€™s ok to cut corners and to use shortcuts if it makes sense
* Working code is better than half finished features.
